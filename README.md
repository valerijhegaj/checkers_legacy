## Rules
- checkers move diagonally on one square only towards the opponent

- checkers eat by jumping over the opponent when he is nearby
- queens can eat by jumping over one checker from anywhere and anywhere diagonally
- you can eat as much as you want in a row and not necessarily have the maximum amount
- if you can eat, you must eat
